** Description **

This is a simple ASCII art generator that takes an image as input and converts it into ASCII art. The program uses the Pillow library to load and manipulate the image, and then uses a set of ASCII characters to represent the different shades of gray in the image. The program also allows the user to specify the width of the output image, and saves the generated ASCII art as a text file.
